# Fuzion has been detected.

The actual cheats, AimTux, Fuzion etc. (forks of AimTux) all have been sigged by Valve's anti cheat. It is recommended to make your own paste or edit the current source code to receive a new signature.

I suggest checking out [Coldpatcher](https://github.com/ikfe/AimTux-ColdPatch) if you want a nice meme.

# EOL

With that said, Hotpatcher reached its end of life. Support will no longer be given.

Feel free to join the Fuzion Discord: https://discord.gg/An8YGmS
